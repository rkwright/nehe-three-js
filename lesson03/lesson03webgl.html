				//    during runtime)
				// In this example we create a perspective camera. Parameters for the perspective
				// camera are ...
				// ... field of view (FOV),
				// ... aspect ratio (usually set to the quotient of canvas width to canvas height)
				// ... near and
				// ... far.
				// Near and far define the cliping planes of the view frustum. Three.js provides an
				// example (http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/examples/
				// -> canvas_camera_orthographic2.html), which allows to play around with these
				// parameters.
